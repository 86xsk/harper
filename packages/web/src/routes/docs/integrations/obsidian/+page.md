title: Harper for Obsidian
---

The **Harper Plugin** is a powerful, privacy-first grammar and spell-checking tool designed specifically for Obsidian users. Unlike many other grammar checkers, Harper operates entirely offline, ensuring your data remains secure while providing real-time, high-performance corrections. This plugin is ideal for writers, academics, and developers who value privacy and efficiency in their workflows.

## **Key Features**

### **1. Privacy-Focused**

- Harper runs **entirely on your device**, meaning no data is sent to external servers.

### **2. Real-Time Grammar and Spell Checking**

- The plugin automatically scans your text as you type, highlighting grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and stylistic inconsistencies.
- Hovering over an error provides instant suggestions for corrections, making editing seamless.

### **3. Lightweight and Fast**

- Built with performance in mind, Harper delivers corrections in milliseconds without slowing down even large vaults.
- It has a minimal memory footprint compared to alternatives like LanguageTool, which can require significant resources.

### **4. Open Source**

- Harper is fully open source, allowing transparency and community contributions to improve its functionality.
- Developers can review the codebase or contribute directly via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/automattic/harper-obsidian-plugin).

### **5. Simple Installation and Integration**
