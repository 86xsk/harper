[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a popular Markdown editor and [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) knowledge vault.
Its extensive plugin ecosystem makes it an attractive choice for note-taking students and documenting professionals.

While one of main features of Obsidian is privacy, a server-side LanguageTool plugin is one of the most popular on the platform.
Harper aims to replace LanguageTool by being faster, better, and entirely private.

## Installation

To add Harper to [Obsidian](/obsidian), just install the community plugin.
More specifically, go to Obsidian's settings and click "Community Plugins."
You may be asked to enable them.
Next, click "Browse" and search for "Harper".
Finally, go back to the Community Plugins page and enable the plugin.
