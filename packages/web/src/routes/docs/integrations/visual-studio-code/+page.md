title: Visual Studio Code
---

With more than 14 million users Visual Studio Code is undeniably the most widely used programming environment in the world.
Most programming languages support doc-comments, a type of inline comment used to generate public-facing documentation.

- [Javadoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc) for Java
- [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) for JavaScript
- [Annex D](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/documentation-comments) for C#.
- ... and many more

The problem: most of these users aren't spending a sufficient amount of time ensuring their comments meet the editorial standards that readers expect.
This can leave a poor first impression on readers.

Fortunately, Harper can help!
By parsing your comments and checking them for style, Harper can significantly improve the professionalism and readability of written documentation.

Just search for "Harper" in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=elijah-potter.harper) and hit install!
