Harper is the next-generation grammar checker for your code. It catches common stylistic errors, as well as complex grammatical or layout-related problems. It works for almost [all common programming languages](./language-server#Supported-Languages) and a number of markup formats.

If you use Rust, Java, JavaScript, or any number of other programming languages, you comments may be ending up as part of your API's documentation. If that's the case, grammatical mistakes in your code could be down-ranking your site on search results and tarnishing your reputation for quality.

Most importantly, Harper runs on-device and uses barely any memory at all. That means you can get feedback on your work in milliseconds, dramatically increasing your iteration speed.

Just search for "Harper" in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=elijah-potter.harper) and hit install!
