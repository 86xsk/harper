For our Visual Studio Code integration, we provide an extension powered by [`harper-ls`](./language-server), which also works for VS Code forks like VSCodium and Windsurf. It's available in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=elijah-potter.harper) as well as the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/elijah-potter/harper).

## Installation

Open the Extensions view in your editor by selecting the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar or by using the `Ctrl+Shift+X` keyboard shortcut, then search for "Harper" and click "Install".

## Commands
