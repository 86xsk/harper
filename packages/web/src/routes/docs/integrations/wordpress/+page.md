## Your Voice Means Something

Harper checks your work for grammatical errors. That's it.

Other grammar checkers try to strip out everything that makes your writing unique.
We believe you should have the freedom to write what's on your mind, not what an LLM thinks you want to hear.
Harper is designed to be fast and **get out of the way**.
