## Is There a Chrome or Firefox Extension?

**Short answer**: not yet.

**Long answer:** at the time of writing, we've just released our first version of `harper.js` ([documentation here](./harperjs/introduction)), which will make it significantly easier to build such a product.
That said, our road map has higher priority items at the moment, so don't expect the offical Harper maintainers to make an attempt in the near future.

If you're interested in trying to make one, let us know how it goes.
We might be able to help.

## Why Doesn't Harper Support My Programming Language?

Harper (particularly `harper-ls`) tries to support a wide variety of programming languages.
If one is missing, it's probably because we haven't had time to get to it yet.
We are entirely open to PRs that add support.

If you just want to be able to run grammar checking on your code's comments, it's actually quite straightforward.
