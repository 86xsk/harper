#problem[
	4. Find all the $x$ values where the following function is discontinuous.
]

#solution[
	$x=-2,0,3$
]

#aside[
	at $x=-2$ jump discontinuity. 
        // this "at" doesn't get flagged

	at $x=0$ infinite discontinuity.
	// this "at" does `This sentence doesn't start with a capital letter`

	at $x=3$ removable discontinuity. (can be removed via re-defining the domain to exclude that)
        // this "at" does `This sentence doesn't start with a capital letter`
]
